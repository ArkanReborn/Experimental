# Python Journey

Hello my name is Arkan I am a Computer Science student at University and this is a repository for me to dump my random projects I do for fun and some that I do in-class if you want to contact me my discord is arkann001

This is really just a grouping of projects in Python that I feel like doing as I learn more about how to program in Python.

Edit (12/2/23)
Since I have finished my intro class I will now use this as a bit of a journal of what I learn and how I continue to learn and use Python in mini-projects
